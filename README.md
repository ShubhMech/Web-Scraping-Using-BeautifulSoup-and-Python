# Web-Scraping-Using-BeautifulSoup-and-Python

In this live project. I tried to collect first 30 topics in alphabetical order that are popular on GitHub.
I also tried to gather links containing various repositories concerning these topics along with the stars the owners have garnered over time.
This project also includes links to all of these repositories and the profile link of their respective owners.
